# Runbooks

Runbooks are written in HCL. Located in `.oj/runbooks/`.

## Available Commands

### build.hcl — Feature development
init → plan agent → implement agent → submit to merge queue

```bash
oj run build my-feature "Add user authentication"
```

### bug.hcl — Bug fixes (worker pool)
Files bug in wok, worker pulls → fix agent → submit → mark done

```bash
oj run fix "Button doesn't respond to clicks"
```

### chore.hcl — Chores (worker pool)
Files chore in wok, worker pulls → agent → submit → mark done

```bash
oj run chore "Update dependencies to latest versions"
```

### draft.hcl — Exploratory work
Pushed to `draft/<name>` branches, not merged.

```bash
oj run draft inline-commands "Execute shell commands locally"
oj run draft-rebase inline-commands   # rebase draft onto main
oj run drafts                         # list open drafts
oj run drafts --close inline-commands # delete a draft branch
```

### merge.hcl — Local merge queue
merge → check → push, with agent conflict resolution

```bash
oj run merge feature/auth-abc123 "feat: add authentication"
oj worker start merge
```

## Writing Runbooks

### Minimal Example

```hcl
command "deploy" {
  args = "<env>"
  run  = { pipeline = "deploy" }
}

pipeline "deploy" {
  vars = ["env"]

  step "build" {
    run     = "make build"
    on_done = { step = "test" }
  }

  step "test" {
    run = "make test"
  }
}
```

## Key Patterns

**Locals** — computed once at pipeline creation, available as `${local.*}`:

```hcl
locals {
  repo   = "$(git -C ${invoke.dir} rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
  branch = "feature/${var.name}-${workspace.nonce}"
  title  = "feat(${var.name}): ${var.instructions}"
}
```

Use `local.repo` to resolve the main repo root from an ephemeral worktree.

**Pipeline name templates** — human-readable names: `name = "${var.name}"`

**Notifications** — desktop alerts on lifecycle: `notify { on_start/on_done/on_fail }`

**Agent gates** — use `on_idle = { action = "gate", run = "make check" }` to verify
agent work via a shell command. No separate check step needed; the gate runs between
nudge cycles and controls step completion.

**Crons** — time-driven pipeline execution:

```hcl
cron "janitor" {
  interval = "30m"
  run      = { pipeline = "cleanup" }
}
```

Start with `oj cron start <name>`, test with `oj cron once <name>`.

**Prime** — inject context at agent session start to reduce tool calls.
Prime commands run as SessionStart hooks. Their output becomes context the
agent can reference immediately without running discovery commands itself.

Array form — cleaner for pure command sequences:

```hcl
agent "medic" {
  prime = [
    "echo '## System Status'",
    "oj status 2>/dev/null || echo 'not running'",
    "echo '## Queues'",
    "oj queue list 2>/dev/null || echo 'no queues'",
  ]
}
```

Script form — natural for mixed static text and dynamic commands:

```hcl
agent "mayor" {
  prime = <<-SHELL
    cat <<'ROLE'
    ## Mayor — Project Coordinator
    You coordinate development across projects...
    ROLE

    echo '## Current Status'
    oj status 2>/dev/null || echo 'daemon not running'
  SHELL
}
```

**Persisted queues as inboxes** — queues aren't just for dispatch. Use them
to collect items for later human review:

```hcl
queue "symptoms" {
  type = "persisted"
}
```

Agents push structured findings; humans review with `oj queue items`.

**Standalone agents** — commands can run agents directly without a pipeline:

```hcl
command "mayor" {
  run = { agent = "mayor" }
}
```

Standalone agents are top-level WAL entities. They run in the invoking
directory (no ephemeral worktree) and are visible via `oj agent list`.

**Crew** — long-lived standalone agents designed for ongoing, interactive
roles (coordinators, triagers, reviewers). Unlike pipeline agents that
complete a task and exit, crew agents may idle waiting for user input.

Key patterns for crew agents:
- `on_idle = { action = "escalate" }` — notify the user instead of nudging
- Put the agent's role, responsibilities, and reference material in `prime`,
  not the prompt. Prime content anchors context summaries when the agent
  compacts. The prompt should be a simple initial instruction.
- Use `--disallowed-tools EnterPlanMode,ExitPlanMode` but allow
  AskUserQuestion so the agent can ask for clarification.

## Best Practices

**Shell:**
- `set -euo pipefail` is automatic
- Use newlines, not `&&` chains
- Use `test`, not `if` statements

**Agents:**
- Always `run = "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions"` (or `--model opus`)
- Set both `on_idle` and `on_dead` handlers
- Use gates (`on_idle = { action = "gate", run = "..." }`) to verify completion
- Keep prompts focused; the orchestrator handles lifecycle
- Use `--disallowed-tools EnterPlanMode,ExitPlanMode` for quick agents (fixes, chores, triage)
- For crew agents, put role/responsibilities in prime (survives compaction), keep prompt minimal
- Use prime to inject system state so agents start with context

**Steps:**
- `on_done = { step = "next" }` for explicit transitions
- `on_fail` for special handling (e.g. conflict resolution agent)
- `run = { agent = "name" }` to invoke agents from steps
- `on_fail = { step = "retry", attempts = 2 }` for bounded retry
- Combine independent shell commands in one step — don't chain separate steps
  for things that don't need individual error handling

**Commands:**
- `run = { pipeline = "name" }` for pipeline dispatch
- `run = <<-SHELL ... SHELL` for inline shell (e.g. launching crons, quick operations)

**Workspaces:**
- `workspace = "ephemeral"` for isolated git worktrees
- Share build cache: `.cargo/config.toml` → main repo's `target/` dir
- Always add a cleanup step: `git worktree remove --force`

**Workers and queues:**
- `queue` + `worker` for pull-based processing
- Queue types: `persisted` (internal) or `external` (backed by wok, etc.)
- Workers have `source`, `handler`, and `concurrency`
