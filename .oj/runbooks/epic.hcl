    You are decomposing a feature epic into concrete, implementable tasks.

    ## Epic

    **Name:** ${var.name}
    **Instructions:** ${var.instructions}

    ## Process

    1. **Explore the codebase thoroughly** — launch 3-5 Explore subagents to understand
       different aspects: architecture, existing patterns, relevant modules, test patterns,
       and dependencies related to this work.

    2. **Clarify requirements** — if the instructions are ambiguous or you need to make
       significant design decisions, use AskUserQuestion to ask the user before proceeding.

    3. **Create the root feature issue:**
       ```
       wok new feature '${var.name}'
       ```
       Note the returned issue ID (the root ID).

    4. **Create blocking task issues** (aim for 3-8 tasks):
       ```
       wok new task '<clear description with acceptance criteria>' --blocks <root-id>
       ```
       Each task should be independently implementable and testable.

    5. **Write the root issue ID** to `.epic-root-id`:
       ```
       echo <root-id> > .epic-root-id
       ```

    6. **Handle dependencies** — if blocked-by IDs were provided ("${var.blocked-by}"),
       run `wok dep <root-id> <id>` for each ID in the comma-separated list.

    ## Task Decomposition Guidelines

    - Each task should be a single, focused unit of work
    - Include clear acceptance criteria in the task description
    - Order tasks so dependencies flow naturally (earlier tasks set up what later ones need)
    - Typical epic has 3-8 tasks — enough granularity for progress tracking without
      over-decomposition
    - Consider: data model changes first, then core logic, then integration, then tests/polish

    When done, say "I'm done" and wait.

agent "epic-builder" {

  on_idle  = { action = "gate", run = "root_id=$(cat .epic-root-id) && ! wok tree \"$root_id\" | grep -qE '(todo|doing)'", attempts = "forever" }
  on_dead  = { action = "recover", append = true, message = "Continue working on the epic. Check `wok tree $(cat .epic-root-id)` for remaining tasks." }

  prime = [
    "wok prime $(cat .epic-root-id)",
    "echo '## Epic Tree'",

    "wok show $(cat .epic-root-id)",
  ]

  prompt = <<-PROMPT
    You are working through an epic, implementing each task until all are complete.

    ## Workflow

    1. Check the current state: `wok tree $(cat .epic-root-id)`
    2. Pick the next unblocked task with status "todo"
    3. Start it: `wok start <task-id>`
    4. Implement the task — write code, write/update tests
    5. Verify: `make check`
    6. Commit changes: `git add -A && git commit -m 'feat(${var.name}): <brief description>'`
    7. Mark done: `wok done <task-id>`
    8. Repeat from step 1 until all tasks are complete

    ## Guidelines

    - **Commit after each task** — not just at the end
    - **Run `make check` before marking done** — ensure nothing is broken
    - **Skip blocked tasks** — if a task depends on another that isn't done, work on a different one
    - **Use conventional commits** — `feat(${var.name}): <description>` for features, `test(${var.name}): ...` for test-only changes
    - **Check progress regularly** — `wok tree $(cat .epic-root-id)` shows the full status
    - When all tasks show as done, say "I'm done"
