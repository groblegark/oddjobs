//! Daemon timer behavior tests

//! Validates the fix from commit 747143d where tokio::time::sleep was changed
//! to tokio::time::interval() for the timer check loop. The original bug was
//! that timers only fired during quiet periods - when events arrived faster
//! than 1 second, the sleep was reset on each iteration and timer checks
//! never occurred.

/// This test validates the fix from commit 747143d:
/// - The main event loop used tokio::time::sleep() inside tokio::select!
/// - When events arrived, the sleep timer was reset to 1 second
/// - This meant timer checks only fired during quiet periods
/// - Fix: Switch to tokio::time::interval() which persists across await points
///
/// The test creates continuous event activity (agent producing output every
/// 500ms) while the daemon's timer mechanism must continue functioning. If
/// the fix weren't in place, the timer check would never fire during this
/// activity, potentially causing liveness monitoring issues.
